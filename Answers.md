1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS tries to the solve the old way of updating data where you have to create a new set of data a piece of data is changed. React takes the data from the DOM and renders it so that it take a reference of the data and returns a copy of updated data.

The old way is like replacing an entire computer when only the graphics card is fried. Why not just replace the graphics card to fix the whole thing instead of buying an entire new desktop?

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react is to think about a hierarchy of components that takes data unidirectionally in a downward stream. The first thing I thought about was a champagne tower fountain. I think it fits really well, especially for alcoholics.

Local data within the component that can be changed. Taken from props.
